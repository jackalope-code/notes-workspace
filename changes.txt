state management updates
bugfix for note creation
update content properly on note deletion and new notes
swap content over to the editing area when a note is selected
update and save note state both offline and online
note page and menu updates
get ready to deploy notes 0.5

demo account, WIP home page, account page, and deployment changes on 0.6


0.7 ish
start something with: tasks, reminders, boards, diagrams. im still missing free form onenote-like note taking, a strong
PC or mobile experience, free-form drawing and diagramming, one off task lists, reoccurring task reminders.

other things to keep in mind:
sticky notes
trello + todoist kind of functionality from previous work

drawing + mobile + offline + sync + reliable + versions + backups + w/e






fix editor sizing and scroll issues
Properly update notes on CRUD operations (offline friendly save as you go for your account)
Button, typography, spacing fixes
Fix the list display of cards for MVP display and interaction

notes arent created with content??
*********

add: Checkable and one off or reocurring notes, and draggable notes. Three systems in total for now (consider making this a serious home/office sutie panel):
    1. an evernote/onenote like note taking page that can share or publish to other things. The core design and a way for me to stay organized. No drawing for
    now but that + executable lang support + other format exports are stretch goals.

    2. Task lists with reocurring or one-off tasks (tasks must be limited plain text and have other constraints so they are different data types from service 1.
    consider importing/exporting between services if it makes sense somwhere.) Tasks could be organized like Trello with no timeframe, or organized like Todoist
    for more complete reminders/scheduling. this should be viewable and somewhat pinnable from the home screen.

    3. draggable note cards that save position and can be used in diagrams (or maybe on the home page as sticky reminder notes?). This could get the most "draw"
    oriented and would have the most in common with onenote. simple draggable cards and diagramming is good enough as its own feature, so maybe start by trying
    to build out simple drawing and diagramming tools. The focus on a subset of tools could still make this useful for software and state diagramming when I want
    more consistency than the blogger/coder/freeform notes of simple service 1.

make mui more consistent; do better with typography, buttons, spacing. Keep fixing the weird stuff and improving on usability. Clean up, refactor, test a bit.

then
Test for mobile and try to get something actually usable and reliable and get it deployed. get a secured demo account going. host the project from the portfolio site.

mobile and offline friendly pwa goal still so keep that in mind.
theres currently no frontend deployment.
